## Exercise 2: Build a Linux and Windows container images and store them in ACR
In this exercise, you will build a Linux- and Windows-based Docker images and pushed them into the Azure Container registry you created earlier in this exercise .

### Task 1: Build a Linux container image and store it in ACR
In this task, you will use a ACR task to build a Linux container image and automatically push it into the ACR.

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon.
1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **Bash**. 
1. If prompted, select **Create storage**, and wait until the Azure Cloud Shell pane is displayed. 
1. Ensure that **Bash** appears in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.
1. From the Bash session within Cloud Shell, create a directory that will host the Dockerfile for the Linux image and change to it from the current directory by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/image-l01
   cd ~/image-l01
   ```

1. In the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, use the built-in editor to create a file named server.js in the image-l01 directory and copy into it the following content:

   ```js
   const http = require('http')
   const port = 80
   const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
     response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'})
     response.write('Hello World from Node\n')
     response.end('Version: ' + process.env.NODE_VERSION + '\n')
   })
   server.listen(port)
   console.log(`Server running at http://localhost: ${port}`)
   ```

   > **Note:** Once running, the resulting Node.js code will display the message **Hello World from Node**.

1. In the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, use the built-in editor again to create a file named package.json in the image-l01 directory and copy into it the following content:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "helloworld",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "Sample app for ACR Build",
     "main": "server.js",
     "scripts": {
       "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
       "start": "node server.js"
     },
     "license": "MIT"
   }
   ```

1. Save the changes to the file and close it to return to the Bash prompt.
1. In the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, use the built-in editor again to create a file named Dockerfile in the image-l01 directory and copy into it the following content:

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM node:20.2-alpine
   COPY . /src
   RUN cd /src && npm install
   EXPOSE 80
   CMD ["node", "/src/server.js"]
   ```

1. Save the changes to the file and close it to return to the Bash prompt.
1. From the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, identify the name of your Azure Container registry you created earlier in this exercise and store it in a variable named **$ACRNAME** by running the following commands:

   ```azurecli
   ACR_RGNAME='acr-01-RG'
   ACR_NAME=$(az acr list --resource-group $ACR_RGNAME --query "[].name" --output tsv)
   ```

1. From the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, create a Docker image based on the Dockerfile stored in the current directory and push it automatically to the Azure Container registry which name is stored in the **$ACRNAME** variable by running the following command (make sure to include the trailing period):

   ```azurecli
   az acr build --registry $ACR_NAME --image hellofromnode:v1.0 .
   ```

   > **Note:** Track the progress of the build and make sure it completes successfully. This should take less than 1 minute.

### Task 2: Build a Windows container image and store it in ACR
In this task, you will use a ACR task to build a Windows container image and automatically push it into the ACR.

1. From the Bash session within Cloud Shell, create a directory that will host the Dockerfile for the Windows image and change to it from the current directory by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/image-w01
   cd ~/image-w01
   ```

1. From the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, clone a public GitHub repo hosting the files you'll use to build the Windows image and switch the current directory to the cloned repo by running the following commands:

   ```git
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dotnetcore-docs-hello-world.git
   cd ~/image-w01/dotnetcore-docs-hello-world
   ```

   > **Note:** The repo contains the source code for a .NET 7 web app which displays the message **Hello World from .NET 7**.

1. From the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, create a Docker image based on the Dockerfile stored in the current directory and push it automatically to the Azure Container registry which name is stored in the **$ACRNAME** variable by running the following command (make sure to include the trailing period):

   ```azurecli
   az acr build --registry $ACR_NAME --image hellofromdotnet:v1.0 --platform windows --file Dockerfile.windows .
   ```

   > **Note:** The name of the Dockerfile defining the Windows image build is **Dockerfile.windows**.

   > **Note:** Track the progress of the build and make sure it completes successfully. This should take less than 3 minutes.

1. Close the Azure Cloud Shell pane.
1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Container registries** page and select the entry representing the Container registry to which you pushed both images.
1. On the Container registry page, in the vertical hub menu, select **Repositories** and verify that **hellofromnode** and **hellofromdotnet** appear in the list of repositories.

## Exercise 3: Deploy container images to AKS 
In this exercise, you will deploy two container images you created earlier in this exercise to the AKS cluster.

> **Note:** Before you proceed with this exercise, make sure that the provisioning of the AKS cluster has successfully completed.

### Task 1: Create custom AKS namespaces

     ports:
     - protocol: TCP
       port: 80
     selector:
       app: hellofromnode
   ```

   > **Note:** The deployment will create pods based on the Linux container image to the Linux node pool in the AKS cluster. In addition, the manifest includes a service, which will provide a load balanced access to the pods in the deployment via a public IP address on port 80.

1. Save the changes to the file and close it to return to the Bash prompt.
1. From the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, replace the **ACR_NAME** placeholder in the file aks-deployment-l01.yaml, by running the following commands:

   ```azurecli
   ACR_RGNAME='acr-01-RG'

     - protocol: TCP
       port: 80
     selector:
       app: hellofromdotnet
   ```

   > **Note:** The deployment will create pods based on the Windows container image to the Windows node pool in the AKS cluster. In addition, the manifest includes a service, which will provide a load balanced access to the pods in the deployment via a public IP address on port 80.

1. Save the changes to the file and close it to return to the Bash prompt.
1. From the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, replace the **ACR_NAME** placeholder in the file aks-deployment-l01.yaml by running the following command:

   ```azurecli
   sed -i "s/ACR_NAME/$ACR_NAME/" ./aks-deployment-w01.yaml
   ```

### Task 4: Perform AKS deployments by using YAML manifest files
In this task, you will deploy both container images to their respective namespaces and node pools in the target AKS cluster.

1. From the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, connect to the AKS cluster, by running the following commands:

   ```azurecli
   AKSRG='aks-01-RG'
   AKSNAME='aks-01'
   az aks get-credentials --resource-group $AKSRG --name $AKSNAME
   ```

1. From the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, verify that the connection was successful, by running the following command:

   ```kubectl
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

   > **Note:** The output of the command should include the listing of all AKS nodes (four in our case).

1. From the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, create the first deployment defined in the corresponding YAML manifest file in the **dev-node** namespace by running the following commands:

   ```kubectl
   cd ~/aks-l01
   kubectl apply -f aks-deployment-l01.yaml -n=dev-node
   ```

   > **Note:** Proceed to the next step without waiting for the deployment to complete. The provisioning of all resources might take a few minutes.

1. From the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, create the second deployment defined in the corresponding YAML manifest file by running the following command:

   ```kubectl
   cd ~/aks-w01
   kubectl apply -f aks-deployment-w01.yaml -n=dev-dotnet
   ```

   > **Note:** Proceed to the next step without waiting for the deployment to complete. The provisioning of all resources might take a few minutes.

# Exercise 4: Review the deployment and deprovision all resources
In this exercise, you will review the results of the deployments and deprovision all resources.

### Task 1: Review the AKS deployments and services
In this task, you will review results of both deployments, including the deployments and services objects.

1. From the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, display the status of both deployments by running the following commands:

   ```kubectl
   kubectl get deployments -n=dev-node
   kubectl get deployments -n=dev-dotnet
   ```

   > **Note:** Before you proceed to the next step, verify that both deployments are listed with the ready status. If that's not the case, wait for another minute, rerun the two aforementioned commands, and check the deployment status again.

1. From the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, display the status of the two services which were included in the manifest files by running the following commands:

   ```kubectl
   kubectl get services -n=dev-node
   kubectl get services -n=dev-dotnet
   ```

1. Verify that the listing for each service includes a value in the **EXTERNAL-IP** column. 
1. Use a web browser to navigate to the IP addresses you identified in the previous step and verify that the resulting web pages display the **Hello World from Node** and **Hello World from .Net 7** messages, respectively.

### Task 2: Delete all resources
In this task, you will delete all resources provisioned in this exercise.

1. From the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, display the listing of resources in the two resource groups provisioned in this exerciseby running the following commands:

   ```azurecli
   az resource list --resource-group 'acr-01-RG' --query "[].name" --output tsv
   az resource list --resource-group 'aks-01-RG' --query "[].name" --output tsv
   ```

   > **Note:** Verify that these are the resources you want to delete. If so, proceed to the next step.

1. From the Bash session of Azure Cloud Shell, delete all resources provisioned in this exercise by running the following commands:

   ```azurecli
   az group delete --name 'acr-01-RG' --no-wait --yes
   az group delete --name 'aks-01-RG' --no-wait --yes
   ```

   > **Note:** The command executes asynchronously (as enforced by the --nowait parameter), so even both commands return immediately to the Bash shell prompt, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups and their resources are actually removed.

1. Close the Azure Cloud Shell pane.
